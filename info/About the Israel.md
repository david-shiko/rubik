You can't build a strong state with weak apparatus and institutions. 
The culture of the elite is filled with either diligence or negligence.

### Personal:
Over the last 9 months, I've sent around 500 resumes and revised it 4 times. Yet, I still haven't 
managed to find a job. During this period, I managed to:
- [write a popular article](https://habr.com/en/articles/709670/),
- [create a portfolio website on GitPages](https://david-shiko.github.io/),
- attend numerous interesting events and hackathons,
- meet a ton of cool and talented people,
but even that didn't help.

Currently, I'm working temporarily as an operator in a bank. Many of my programmer friends in this 
country have met a similar fate.

It's amusing: the banking software and I are roughly the same age. Three-fourths of my work is wasted 
simply because upper management doesn't deem it necessary to update the old software. This is a 
disrespect for human labor. I could write software twice as good in 1-2 years, but instead, I serve it.

I feel like the first casualty in the uprising of machines.

### Recent Events in Israel:
I'm really sorry that I'm releasing my code so late. If each of us had a better half, perhaps we'd spend 
less time on war and value life more. 
Unfortunately, this is an inevitable outcome. 
You can't drastically reduce casualties without drastically improving leadership skills. 
Focus not on the consequences, but on the causes.

The favorite word in Israel is "בסדר" ("okay"). This is how state leaders, businessmen, and managers respond 
when asked for an assessment. However, the current situation is far from "בסדר," it's completely not "בסדר."
Israel is facing a transformation where local "בסדר" will be replaced by a professional "report" with all 
the figures, analyses, and conclusions.

### About Transport
I highly value the simplicity and freedom of movement; it brings my ideas to life. 
Unfortunately, I've faced issues with this in this country. 
Back in my home country, I had a beloved white motorcycle that would take me places quickly and energize me for the day.
Despite my driving experience and life in a motorcycle community here, I failed the test twice.

The Ministry and examiners make the exam so unpleasant that even upon successful completion, there's no joy in it. 
It's not an accomplishment; it's a humiliation and compliance to unworthy individuals. 
Living away from my beloved motorcycle and club has negatively impacted my morale, code quality, and code quantity. 
I also fear that my motorcycle will be stolen here, as my e-scooter was stolen.

Cars don't work for me; traffic and parking shortages make it too complex and draining 
for people like me. Instead of charging me with energy, it sucks it away.

Buses could've been a good solution, but their primary target audience is the elderly. 
While it's not openly discussed, the narrow roads and frequent stops every 3 minutes are not made for anyone else. 
Also, they don't operate from Friday noon until Saturday evening (Shabbat).

I bought an e-scooter, but it got stolen quickly. Almost all my friends have similar stories; 
some even have two. 
Interesting fact: A detective at the police station told me, 
"Genius, you locked your e-scooter where it's honey for thieves." 
This phrase will be my tagline to describe this country for years.
(BTW I appreciate his honestness and attempt to explain the situation)

I'm not just concerned for myself; I can deal with ministry bureaucracy, traffic jams, lack of 
parking, and theft. What I can't accept is the lack of a mobility plan for residents. 
The government's approach doesn't reflect my mindset; my energy is drained by traffic and searching for buses. 
The lack of freedom of movement is a stumbling block, making me consider leaving this country.


### The Good Side!
This country has one magnificent quality that outweighs 50 negatives: the people are amazing! 
I've never encountered such a high percentage of rational individuals anywhere else. 
Although we argue, we're willing to listen and consider different perspectives. 
I deeply value this societal quality to listen, analyze, and evolve. 
It's paradoxical to me how such wonderful people could have built such a mediocre nation. 
It seems as if the country has been hijacked by its native mafia, oligarchs, and opportunistic politicians.
