*Make Love, Not War*    
 I've been working on this project for most of my conscious life._    
    
> When I was young, I pondered what is most important in the world, what will undoubtedly make it better, and     
> who should I be? Should I fight the state, embrace religion, art, become a surgeon, musician, or rabbi?    
    
Gradually, I realized that the most important thing in life is love; no matter what a person does, there should    
always be a loyal ally beside them. Perhaps people become bad because they lack such a person or because they    
themselves are unloved. Finding love is a kind of wealth, as significant as inheriting a fortune or having robust    
health.  
    
Moreover, there are people more talented than me in every field, **but the world has yet to encounter one thing:**  
_**a technology that can mathematically, and within minutes, find a person's soulmate.**_  
_This is more than just  matchmaking; it's a way to professionally connect people._

### Future Projects    
    
I have many more ideas in the pipeline:
    
1. **A new GitHub for forming a complete project team**, including designers, managers, etc.    
2. **A service based on a family tree/mind map** for structuring information about the state, laws, initiatives, etc.    
3. **Goodsbase** - Centralized information about goods, maintained directly by the creators of the products. Products    
   refer to each other and create a composition. Any complex product is a composition of more primitive products.    
4. **A logical and justified decision-making service based on mind maps**. Each decision should be convertible into a    
   tree (graph) form, where the root (vertex) is the problem, the edges (branches) are accompanying issues, and the    
   graphs (leaves) are Boolean answers (yes/no). Thus, any decision can be decomposed down to primitive atomic    
   "yes"/"no" statements. Complex strategies and decisions in politics, economics, legislation, etc., are based on    
   simple statements.    
5. **A service for evaluating programmers**. This is a specific system that allows understanding not just the    
   professionalism of a programmer, but also the relevance of their experience for a particular position. It is    
   based on two things: metrics from Leetcode, Codewars, Exercism, etc., and the analysis of imported libraries and    
   methods in the programmer's codebases.    
    
These are just the ones that I consider the most important, which directly affect the world and people; I'll leave    
business ideas aside.

### For Investors:  
This code makes up roughly **50%** of the asset. The remaining **50%** consists of:  
- **Mobile Application (15%)**  
- **Design (10%)**  
- **Management Info: tables, cases, mind maps, etc. (25%)**  
  
**In simple terms**, it's a typical dating service enhanced by an algorithm for sorting people   
based on common interests. 
**In reality**, it's a _next-gen social network that determines who you'll   
find interesting for dating, socializing, doing business, and leaving a legacy in seconds._
  

When people ask me, "What if it doesn't take off?", I always think, damn, it's based on sorting   
people by common interests—I want to use this just hearing about it! Even if it doesn't work, it's   
worth a try for everyone. I endlessly believe in this project and approach.  
My vision for the service goes far beyond current developments and designs, at least by threefold. 
_My goal is to sort everyone on the planet, find each person a match, and a society where they can realize their potential._
On this foundation, the best teams will form, where everyone's ideas and visions complement each other.   
Companies and parliaments will be built, unified by a common goal.

### Donations:  
I've spent approximately **$15,000** on this code, most of it from my savings, refugee aid, and a   
severance package. I was lost, not knowing what to do post-layoff, so I just did what I do best—code.   
I'd be pleased if people worldwide find this idea useful. It would inspire me; maybe I'd feel like Linus   
Torvalds, receiving postcards from around the world.

I apologize for the oversight. The lines were not strictly formatted to 120 characters. Here's a revised version:

### FROM ME:
- Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.
  (c) Winston Churchill

- With bad laws and good civil servants it's still possible to govern. 
  But with bad civil servants even the best laws can't help.  
  (c) Otto von Bismarck

- At the foundation of every civilization lies a startling paradox: the individual balances the power of the crowd. 
  (c) Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

- Divide and rule, a sound motto. Unite and lead, a better one.
  (c) Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

- Don't focus on the disagreements; we already have plenty of those. 
  Concentrate on unity, as it is the most powerful weapon.

- I don't believe in 'isms.' Capitalism, communism, pragmatism—following any 'ism' is like trying
  to reach a destination by going only north or only west.

- I don't believe in weak people; I believe in tired people. When does a person become weak? When they 
  take their first breath, utter their first word, attend first grade, or land their first job?

 I write all this here because I don't respect social networks and have no followers there.

### GRATITUDE:

- Immense gratitude to the PTB community [PTB Telegram Group](https://t.me/pythontelegrambotgroup). 
  This project uses Telegram for its demo. Interactions are through Python Telegram Bot framework.
  They've helped me with every question in the early stages; without them, this project might not exist.
  This is the best open-source community I know; no other responds as quickly.
  They're so quick that sometimes it seems they're paid, but that's unlikely. They've set a standard of 
  quality for me.
- Gratitude to [SPb Python Telegram Group](https://t.me/spbpython); they've been a great help in the early stages.

### DEMO:

- My bot instance is [@Rubik_Love_bot](https://t.me/Rubik_Love_bot).
- My post channel is [RubikLovePosts](https://t.me/RubikLovePosts).
  No promises about active development, but if it gains traction, I'll devote more time. Remember, you can 
  create your own group and run your own bot instance.
  Post groups are likely the priority for the open-source version's development.
- General channel: [Social DS](https://t.me/social_ds)
  I'm not fond of writing or persuading, but remaining silent when you know the solution is a form of negligence.
