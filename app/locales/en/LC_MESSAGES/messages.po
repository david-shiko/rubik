# Long comments for line: "Plural-Forms: nplurals=2; plural=(n != 1);\n"
# 1) Reason for the rule:
# English, like many other languages, has a grammatical system for expressing quantity.
# Singular and plural are grammatical numbers that potentially impact all parts of speech.
# It is essential to correctly translate these nuances to maintain the naturalness of the language in software.
#
# 2) Workflow and specification:
# We use the "Plural-Forms" attribute to provide gettext with the rules for pluralization in English.
# This attribute helps gettext understand how to select the correct translation depending on the numerical context.
# The "nplurals" parameter is used to specify the total number of grammatical numbers in the language, which is 2 for English.
# The "plural" condition provides the logic to select between these forms based on the given quantity.
#
# 3) Implementation:
# The condition "n != 1" in the "plural" attribute means if the quantity `n` is not equal to 1, use the plural form.
# When `n` equals 1, it means we are dealing with a singular entity, so we use the singular form.

msgstr ""
"What does the bot do?\n"
"- The bot will find friends or a partner for you, and perhaps or not, love is a complex thing, it's worth a try anyway.\n"
"How will it do this?\n"
"- The bot will analyze your likes, thereby understanding your inner world.\n"
"Presumably, two people with a common inner world form love, but this is not exact.\n"
"\n"
"How to use the bot?\n"
"- The bot's operation consists of two spaces:\n"
"1. Personal space will show how many common interests you have with a specific person.\n"
"(This could be a friend, girlfriend, or family member).\n"
"2. Public space will show people with the most common interests for you.\n"
"(You can apply filters by gender, age, dating goal, etc.)\n"
"\n"
"I want to try personal space, how do I do this? - Command: \"{{PERSONAL_SCENARIO_CMD}}\".\n"
"- 3 steps:\n"
"1. Rate personal posts (give likes or dislikes).\n"
"2. Indicate the person with whom you want to know the amount of common interests.\n"
"3. Done! The bot will conduct an analysis and tell the % of common interests and other interesting figures.\n"
"\n"
"I want to try public space, how do I do this? - Command: \"{{GLOBAL_SCENARIO_CMD}}\".\n"
"- 3 steps:\n"
"1. Rate personal posts (give likes or dislikes).\n"
"2. Start a search for common interests and find out.\n"
"3. Done! - The bot will show people with the most common interests for you,\n"
"and also apply the filters you set to them.\n"
"\n"
"What is the result of the bot's work?\n"
"- The bot will show how many common interests you have with other users or a user.\n"
"Based on this, you can make acquaintances.\n"
"\n"
"What do common interests give me?\n"
"- Common interests are designed to help you make acquaintances with people,\n"
"who are interesting to you and to whom you are interesting.\n"
"This is a new filter that exists little elsewhere.\n"
"\n"
"Why like posts?\n"
"- For the bot to be able to find you acquaintances based on interests - it needs to know your interests.\n"
"Liking posts - is a way to tell the bot what you like.\n"
"\n"
"What does registration give me?\n"
"- Registration allows other people to find you when they do a search.\n"
"When you use the \"{{SEARCH_CMD}}\" command - you are looking for people who are already registered.\n"
"For your profile to appear in the search results of other people - you need to register.\n"
